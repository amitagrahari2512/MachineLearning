Machine Learning With Python

Python libraries for Machine Learning

numpy - Scientific computing
pandas - data frames
matplotlib - 2D plotting
scikit-learn - 
			- Design to work with NumPy, SciPy and Pandas
			- Toolset for training and evaluation tasks
				- Data Splitting
				- Pre-Processing
				- Performance-Evoluation
				- Feature Selection
				- Model Training
				- Model Tuning
			- Common Interface across algorithms
				

Machine learning works :
	1 - Asking the right question
	2 - Preparing Data
	3 - Selecting the Algorithm
	4 - Training the model
	5 - Testing the model
	
1 - Asking the right question : 
	- Get Data
	- Remove Corelated data
	
2 - Preparing a Data : 
	- convert data as per needed

3 - Selecting the Algorithm : (Lots of Algorithm available, we need to select one ,and train our data)
	1-Algo Naive Bayes (Based on likelihood and probability, every feature has the same weight, Requires smaller amount of data)
	2-Algo Logistic Regression(confusing Name, Binary result, RelationShip between features are weighted)
	3-Algo Decision Tree (Binary tree, Node contains decision, Requires enough data to determine node and split, 
		But best part it has a tool to picture of trees, so we can see how deceision work)
		
	Missing Data : 
			Common problem
			Options to Solve:
				1 - Ignore
				2 - Drop Observations(rows)
				3 - Replace values(Impute)
					1 - Replace with Mean, Median
					2 - Replace with expert knowledge derived value

4 - Training the model :

5 - Testing The model : 
			

Performance Improvement Options:
						1 - Adjust Current Algorithm
						2 - Get more data or improve data
						3 - Improve Training
						4 - Switch Algorithm
							

Algorithm Random Forest : 
			Ensemble Algorithm
			Fits multiple trees with subsets of data
			Average tree results to improve performance and control overfitting

Algorithm Logistic Regression :

Algorithm CV Variants : 
	Algorithm + Cross Validation = AlgorithmCV

Fixing Overfitting : 
	Regularization Hyperparameter
	cross vaidation
	Bias - variance trade off
	
Unbalanced Classes :
